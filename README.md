Analyzing U.S. Voter Demographics Using the PivotTable created in the U.S. Voters case study

This project focuses on analyzing U.S. voter demographics using data from the U.S. Voters case study. The analysis leverages a PivotTable in Excel to explore and visualize key demographic patterns, such as voter age, gender, race, and geographic distribution. By manipulating the PivotTable, insights into voter trends and behavior are extracted to inform decision-making and policy discussions. The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of U.S. voting habits, with the goal of identifying significant trends and disparities.
